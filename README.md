# odin-recipes

This basic website will be for showcasing recipes. This is my first project whilst following The Odin Project web development course.

The aims of this website are to practice my HTML skills only, no CSS or JS will be included.

The skills I would have demonstrated include: titles, paragraphs, styles, links, images, lists, file structure, and basic git processes.
